        <span class="js" id="first"><span class="js">JavaScript</span></span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)[9], often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] <span class="js"><span class="js">JavaScript</span></span> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
        Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.<br>
        As a multi-paradigm language, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides <span class="js">JavaScript</span> APIs for I/O.<br>
        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.<br>
        Although there are similarities between <span class="js">JavaScript</span> and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
